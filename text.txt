Key Adjustments for Machine Bias Detection:

1. Focus on AI-generated Scores – We analyze if the AI scoring system systematically favors/disfavors certain skills.

2. Check Model Predictions – Compare AI-generated candidate rankings against fairness metrics.

3. Bias Mitigation in AI Model – Adjust AI decision-making instead of modifying input data.

2️⃣ Detect Skill Bias – Check if highly skilled candidates were unfairly rejected.
3️⃣ Mitigate Bias – Adjust AI scoring to prevent unfair filtering.
